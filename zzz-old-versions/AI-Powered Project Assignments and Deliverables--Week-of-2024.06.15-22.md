Hello AI-Powered Project Leaders, 

Attached are the project resource documents that we discussed on Saturday.  
The most important Project Description templates and 6D Agile outline are included.

# Your AI-Powered development project(s) assignment this week include:

1) Develop and commit your project deliverables to Github incrementally,
        6D Agile Stages ==>  Define, Design, Develop, Debug, Document, Deliver, [Deploy]

2) Email me a short progress status reports after each work session your team work or individual 
    (or at least three days this week).

See the DELIVERABLES DEADLINES below.

#######################################################################
# ASSIGNMENTS, GITHUB.COM COMMITS, AND EMAIL STATUS REPORTS:

Commit your project deliverables to your PUBLIC Github.com project repositories.

Rich will be present this week and monitoring your commits to your PUBLIC Github.com project repositories, as you execute your teams or individual projects.  

Each project leader (team or individual) must email me your Agile process update after each meeting, or at least 3 days per week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
 
        6D Agile Stages ==>  Define, Design, Develop, Debug, Document, Deliver, [Deploy]

# MESSAGING:  In your email Subject line, use this prompt code at the start:

    "AIP_{nn}_{your_FML_initials}_{short_title}" to identify your progress report

        nn = project number, starting at 01 and incrementing upward

        your_initials = FirstMiddleLast name intials, e.g., RSL.  (if no middle name, use 2)

        short_title = project title <=20 characters long.
        (Example) Project Plan for AI-Powered Training Project (see attached)

######################################################################
# MEETING TIMES AND LOGISTICS:

Meeting Times:  
Your teams can meet whenever you want, using whatever meeting and collaboration techologies you want.  

Create and use a free ZOOM meeting account. 
Planning and check-in meetings should never take longer than 40 minutes.
If they do then swap to your teammate's account.  

   RESULTS ARE WHAT REALLY MATTER (Not "when" you do the work.)

######################################################################
# PROJECT WORK DELIVERABLES EXPECTATIONS :

    EVERYONE :
        Spend your normal 20+ hours required training effort on project work.
        Progress must represent at least 20 hours of effort focused on your projects.
       
        If you finish your project completely in less than 20 hours, do another project.

        Your larger goal is to flesh out your AI Projects Portfolio to amaze employers.
