Rebecca loved Corina and wanted to be more than just friends, but Doctor Joseph Barsetti had taken Corina back to his home town of Boston in Massachusetts after they were married, and Rebecca had never forgiven him. She was sure Corina would want to be with her if he hadnOt taken her away, so ten years later Rebecca goes to Boston to declare her undying love for Corina after not being able to rebuild her life without her. Will Rebecca get her girl at long last, or will Joseph stop her in her tracks? An addictive read, which is the sequel to Flossy Abraham's, 'The Girl He Left Behind.'
