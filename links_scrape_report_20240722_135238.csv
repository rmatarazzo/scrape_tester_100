It is, perhaps, the only metal universally accepted as a form of wealth, long before the first coins were ever minted. </p>

Greedy King Midas was cursed with the Golden Touch and everything he touched was turned to Gold, including his beloved daughter. Jason and the Argonauts searched for the fabled Golden Fleece against Herculean odds, a mythological tale rooted in reality. Ancient miners used a sheep’s fleece as a type of sieve to capture the tiny, but heavy, flakes of Gold found in water. After the fleece dried, it was gently shaken and the Gold flakes were collected. This method was even practiced by some miners in the California Gold Rush of 1849.</p>",Keywords meta tag not found.,
