## Project Name: a descriptive title (should be "catchy" for marketing purposes)
Scrape Tester 100


## Project and Work Product Description:  (should be 1 CONCISE paragraph, 3-7 sentences)
	• Answer "This project / work product (solution) fills these gaps... "
    
	Identify websites suitable for web scraping automatically.
	User is prompted to enter a topic that will be used to generate a list of up to 100 relevant websites.
	The program builds a list of their links.
	Each link is tested for web scraping capabilities.
	The program generates a report for the user that identifies which websites were successfully scraped and which ones failed along with corresponding error codes.
			
    • Main goals and problem(s) it solves.
	
	Provide a list of websites that can be used for a topic of interest that are suitable for web scraping.
	Saves time by filtering potential websites for a project and identifying those suitable for web scraping and data extraction.
	
	• Problem and Solution Workflow Diagrams (2 flowcharts "AS-IS" and "TO-BE")
	
	AS-IS Workflow:
	Textual Description:

	User Input: User enters a topic for web scraping.
	Manual Search: User manually searches and identifies websites related to the entered topic, up to 100 websites.
	Manual Link Compilation: User manually compiles a list of links from the identified websites.
	Manual Capability Check: User manually checks each link to determine its potential for successful web scraping.
	Manual Report Generation: User manually generates a report listing websites successfully scraped and those that failed, with error details.	


	TO-BE Workflow:
	Textual Description:

	User Input: User provides a topic for web scraping.
	Automated Website Identification: Program automatically searches and identifies websites relevant to the provided topic.
	Automated Link Compilation: Automatically compiles a list of links from the identified websites.
	Test Web Scraping Capability: Automated test scrape for each identified link to determine if it can be successfully scraped.
	Error Handling: Handle errors encountered during testing and scraping, categorize them with appropriate error codes.
	Generate Comprehensive Report: Produce a detailed report listing websites successfully scraped and those that failed, including error details.
