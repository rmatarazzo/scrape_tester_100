# Scrape Tester 100

## Provide a list of websites that can be used for a topic of interest that are suitable for web scraping.

### Saves time by filtering potential websites for a project and identifying those suitable for web scraping and data extraction.

#### The solution automates the identification and evaluation of websites suitable for web scraping based on a user-provided topic. Upon receiving the topic, the program automatically searches and compiles a list of up to 100 relevant websites. Each website is then subjected to an automated test scrape to assess its suitability for data extraction. The program handles any errors encountered during the testing phase and generates a comprehensive report, detailing which websites were successfully scraped and which ones failed, along with corresponding error codes. This automation significantly reduces manual effort and increases the efficiency and accuracy of identifying scrappable websites.
